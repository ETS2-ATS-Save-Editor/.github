## ⚠️ **Important Notice (All Users)**

### **Save Integrity Warning**

Improper editing can cause:

- Broken profiles
- Missing trucks or garages
- Economy desynchronization
- Game crashes on load
- Permanent save corruption

Always rely on the **automatic backup system** before applying changes.

---

## **Automatic Backups**

Before any modification, the editor creates:

- A full copy of the original save file
- A timestamped restore point for easy rollback

Backups are stored in:

Documents/American Truck Simulator OR Euro Truck Simulator 2/save_backups/


Restoring a backup is as simple as replacing the edited save with a backup copy.
